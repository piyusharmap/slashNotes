## About Project
This project is designed to server the backend functionalities for a note taking application using Node.js. It is suitable for Web apps, Mobile apps and Api services.

## About Author
I <a target="_blank" href="https://www.piyusharmap.com/home">Piyush Sharma</a> have create this project as a part of MLH prep and fellowship program. 
I've experience with both backend and full stack developement but don't have experience working in the industry. 
Through this program I want to learn and enhance my developemt skills.

## Project Instructions
I designed this project using Node.js. The main focus is to create a maintainable application with proper error handling.
<br />Following are the project details and instructions:-
<ul>
<li>The backend is written in javascript. The framework used in backend (Express). Express is a Node.js back-end web application framework, also known as Express.js. It has many features that make developing web applications easier and faster than using Node.js</li>
<li>Centralised Error handling: I have created a framework where all the errors are handled centrally. This reduces the ambiguity in the development when the project grows larger.</li>
<li>Mongodb is used through Mongoose: Mongodb fits very well to the node.js application. Being NoSQL, fast, and scalable makes it ideal for modern web applications.</li>
<li>A pure backend project: I have experienced that when a backend is developed clubbed with a frontend then in the future it becomes really difficult to scale. We would want to create a separate backend project that servers many websites and mobile apps.</li>
</ul>

### Architecture
3-tier Architecture: A 3-tier architecture is a web app architecture that is widely used around the world. It basically contains 3 tiers: Client, Server, and Database
<br />The Business Logic Tier (Controller) is written using NodeJs and ExpressJS, and this tier represents the Application Server that will act as a bridge of communication for the Client Tier and Database Tier. This tier will serve HTML pages to the userâ€™s device and accept HTTP requests from the user and follow with the appropriate response.
<br />THe Database Tier (Model) will be hosting MongoDB. This is where we will store all of the crucial data our application needs to function.
